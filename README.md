# BluntPriceIndex

My research identifies the street blocks with the highest/lowest prices for a blunt along a neighborhood corridor. I estimate the probability a shop would price a blunt above the median price.  I use a multinomial logit model ("logistic regression") to estimate how much a blunt price is influenced by location, social forces, etc.  I am curious how the price of a blunt changes along a city street.
