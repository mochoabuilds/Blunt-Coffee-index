*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains the data for the Blunt index, and code for its calculations. The Blunt index could be a helpful supplement to official city figures.

# DATA & CALCULATIONS

* My research collects blunt prices (32 oz gatorade prices, etc.) from more than 200 corner stores during 10 to 14 day intervals. I then estimate the probability a store would price a blunt above the median using multinomial logistic regression, response variables and select outcome measures.  From there I create the adjusted Blunt index to interpret coefficients as pricing probabilities, which signals where purchasing power is strongest/weakest across a city based on location.

# OUTPUT DATA 

* date
* local_price
* street_block
* census_tract
* city_ward
* BLUNT_adjusted - Adjusted index

# EXPERIMENTS & TRIALS

# WEB APP 

* Form a digital bridge between different corner store customers via news graphics, stories, etc.

# DISCUSSION

* Chicago will grow, we should better understand its flow. Hanging out around corner stores could show us fresh ways to gauge activity in smaller pockets of the economy. The Blunt index could be a helpful supplement to official city figures.  The frequency of my data collection could help city officials boost the timeliness and quality of their own data.
