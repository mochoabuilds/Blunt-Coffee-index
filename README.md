*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains the price data, code for calculations and a web app. 

# DATA COLLECTION & CALCULATIONS

* My research collects blunt and coffee prices, dates, neighborhood of collected prices and ethnographic field notes from 200+ neighborhood shops during 10 to 14 day intervals. I then learn how each of all this data relates to various outcomes. My goal is to estimate the probability a shop would price a blunt and coffee above the city median.  

# INPUT DATA 

* date
