# The Blunt Index

I am curious how the price of a blunt changes along a city street. My research looks for the street blocks with the highest & lowest prices for a blunt in Chicago's neighborhoods. I estimate the probability a store would price a blunt above the median price using a multinomial logit model ("logistic regression") to estimate how much price is influenced by location, social forces, etc.
