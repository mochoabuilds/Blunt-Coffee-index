*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains the data for the Blunt index, and code for its calculations. My research collects blunt prices from more than 200 corner stores during ten to fourteen day intervals. I then estimate the probability a store would price a blunt above the city median using multinomial logistic regression, select outcome measures and response variables.  From this I create the adjusted Blunt index to interpret coefficients as pricing probabilities. This index signals where purchasing power is strongest/weakest across a city.

# SOURCE DATA

* Price data comes from comes from commerce corridors in Chicago's neighborhoods; socio-economic data comes from Social Explorer reports.

# OUTPUT DATA

Variables
* date
* local_price
* street_block
* census_tract
* zip_code
* BLUNT_adjusted - Adjusted index

# CALCULATING THE BLUNT INDEX

# DISCUSSION

* Based on experiments I share why the ease and low cost of the Blunt index could help keep track of changes in purchasing power across neighborhoods, as they happen, rather than in unknown intervals.
