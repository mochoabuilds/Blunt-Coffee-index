*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains price data, calculations and a newsy web app. 

# DATA COLLECTION & CALCULATIONS

* My research collects blunt/coffee prices, dates and locations from 200+ neighborhood shops during 10 to 14 day intervals. I then teach a system to learn how this data correlates with various outcomes. Logistic regression calculates the log-odds of a categorical response being "true".  The goal is to show how increases/decreases in price are associated with change in the log-odds of a variable.

# INPUT DATA 

* date
* blunt_price
* coffee_price
* street_block
* tbd

# OUTPUT DATA

* BLUNTCOFFEE_adjusted - Adjusted odds index, etc.

# TRIALS

# DISCUSSION

* The timeliness and quality of the Blunt-Coffee index could be a helpful supplement to official city figures.

# WEB APP

* Build a digital bridge that integrates all this data to make updating the Blunt-Coffee index easier.
