# "The Blunt Index"

* I am curious how the price of a blunt changes across the city. My research collects blunt prices from more than 100 stores for five to seven consecutive days.  All the prices are then paired with data from the census to create a picture of blunt prices based on locational socio-economic characteristics. I also estimate the probability a store would price a blunt above the median price using logistic regression and 5000+ labeled examples to estimate how much price is influenced by location, social forces, etc. 

# DATA COLLECTION AND PREP

# DATA ANALYSIS

# DISCUSSION

Based on results I argue that the relative ease and low cost of data collection could serve as a way of keep track of changes in city consumer price indexes, as they happen, rather than in unknown intervals.
