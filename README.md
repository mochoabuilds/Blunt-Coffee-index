# "The Blunt Index"

* I am curious how the price of a blunt changes across the city. My research looks for the street blocks with the highest & lowest prices for a blunt in Chicago's neighborhoods. I estimate the probability a store would price a blunt above the median price using logistic regression, a simple machine learning, and 5000+ labeled examples to estimate how much price is influenced by location, social forces, etc.
