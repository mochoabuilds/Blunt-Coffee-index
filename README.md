*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains the price data for the Blunt-Coffee index, and code for its calculations. 

# DATA & CALCULATIONS

* My research collects blunt and coffee prices from more than 200 neighborhood shops during 10 to 14 day intervals. I then estimate the probability a shop would price a blunt  and coffee above the city median using multiple logistic regression.  Next I calculate the adjusted Blunt index to interpret select coefficients as pricing probabilities (i.e.  signals where the odds of the price are ___ times the odds of the city median)

# OUTPUT DATA 

* date
* local_price
* street_block
* BLUNTCOFFEE_adjusted - Adjusted odds index

# EXPERIMENTS & TRIALS

# DISCUSSION

* Chicago will grow, we should better understand its flow. Hanging out around its neighbohood shops could show us new ways to gauge the activity of informal life in smaller pockets of the economy. The timeliness and quality of the Blunt-Coffee index could be a helpful supplement to official city figures.
