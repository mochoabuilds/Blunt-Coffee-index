*** WORKING PAPER ***

# INTRODUCTION

* This repository contains coffee/blunt prices, code for multiple logisitc regression and a web app.  

# DATA COLLECTION & CALCULATIONS

* My research collects blunt/coffee prices, dates and locations from 200+ neighborhood shops during 10 to 14 day intervals. I then teach a system to learn how this data correlates with various outcomes. I predict whether a shopper is overpaying for a coffee/blunt, on the basis of annual income, neighborhood property values and employment status. The estimated coefficients of the logistic regression predict the probability of overpaying for a coffee/blunt belongs to a particular category.
